Example: Same Query Using curl

ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token_here"
BASE_URL="https://api.logging-service.paloaltonetworks.com"

curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/logquery" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "SELECT * FROM traffic LIMIT 10"}'

After submitting the query, note the jobId in the response. Use that ID to retrieve the results:

curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/logquery/<jobId>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
